/**
 * @class IncreaseEconomy
 * @brief A concrete command that simulates an economic boom, leading to increased job creation and a rise in citizen net worth.
 * 
 * The `IncreaseEconomy` class inherits from `EventsCommand` and represents an event where the economy experiences 
 * significant growth. This can lead to more industrial and commercial buildings, providing new job opportunities 
 * and increasing the wealth of citizens. The economic boom also stimulates various aspects of city life, 
 * including real estate, consumption, and public services.
 * 
 * @details When this command is executed, it will trigger processes that expand the cityâ€™s industrial and 
 * commercial sectors, improve citizen wealth, and possibly lead to other positive economic effects. 
 * The increased economic activity will create a need for additional resources, infrastructure, and services 
 * to support the city's growth.
 * 
 * @note This class works in tandem with other city management systems to simulate a holistic economic boom.
