/**
 * @class BabyBoom
 * @brief A concrete command that simulates a sudden increase in population due to a baby boom event.
 * 
 * The `BabyBoom` class inherits from `EventsCommand` and represents an event where the population 
 * of the city sees a significant rise due to an increase in birth rates. This event can impact various 
 * city aspects such as housing demand, resource allocation, and overall citizen behavior.
 * 
 * @details When executed, this command triggers a process that adjusts the population count within 
 * the simulation, creating new citizens and potentially leading to subsequent effects on the city's 
 * infrastructure, economy, and services. The increase in population can have implications for 
 * resource management, schooling, and housing policies, requiring adjustments to the city's planning.
 * 
 * @note This class does not directly handle the creation of new citizens but interacts with the 
 * relevant systems responsible for population management.
